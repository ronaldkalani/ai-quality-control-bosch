## Project Overview

This project simulates a complete AI-based quality engineering pipeline for the automotive manufacturing sector. It leverages Bosch's real-world production sensor data to build defect classification models, perform root cause analysis, simulate supplier drift, apply SPC techniques, and generate a simplified FMEA with visual tools such as Pareto charts and process flow mapping.

## ðŸ›  Strategy & Pipeline Steps

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing
- Mounted Google Drive to access Bosch data: `train_numeric.csv`, `train_date.csv`, `train_categorical.csv`  
- Loaded a subset (100,000 rows) due to memory limits  
- Missing values handled with `.fillna(-1)`  

### 2. Inline Defect Detection (XGBoost)
- Classification model to predict part failure using `Response` as target  
- Train/test split with `stratify=y` to preserve class imbalance  
- Model trained using `XGBClassifier` with logloss eval metric  
- Classification report highlights class 1 (fail) performance  

### 3. Feature Importance Analysis
- Extracted top 10 features based on model weights  
- Horizontal bar chart plotted to reveal most critical sensor stations impacting outcomes  

### 4. Statistical Process Control (SPC)
- Process durations calculated from `train_date.csv` timestamp range  
- XÌ„ chart plotted using mean and Â±3Ïƒ to show process variation and anomalies  
- Helps identify stations going out of control  

### 5. Root Cause Analysis (Correlation Matrix)
- Correlation between features and the failure label  
- Top 10 sensor correlations with defects extracted  
- Visualized using seaborn heatmap to identify redundant and key contributors  

### 6. Quality Improvement Initiative
- Removed noisy/highly correlated features  
- Retrained the model and compared recall scores to demonstrate impact of corrective actions  

### 7. Supplier Quality Simulation
- Simulated 3 batches (suppliers A, B, and C) with induced signal drift  
- Evaluated defect rates across simulated suppliers to reflect incoming material quality variation  

### 8. DOE (Design of Experiments)
- Sensor variable artificially modified to simulate process change  
- Classifier retrained and evaluated to observe model robustness  
- Demonstrated impact of pressure/timing shifts in a test scenario  

### 9. FMEA & Control Plan
- Manually constructed simplified FMEA matrix for critical sensors  
- RPN (Risk Priority Number) calculated as Severity Ã— Occurrence Ã— Detection  
- Ranked sensor risks and proposed mitigation in markdown table format  

### 10. Pareto Chart for Defect Types
- Simulated defect causes (e.g., sensor drift, calibration error)  
- Plotted bar chart + cumulative line for classic 80/20 defect distribution analysis  

### 11. Process Flow Mapping
- ASCII-style process flow visual outlining production line checkpoints  
- Mimics standard automotive process flow (Material Input â†’ Sensor â†’ QC â†’ Assembly/Rework)

##  Key Challenges

- Severe class imbalance (failures < 1%)  
- Over 970 features â€“ difficult to interpret  
- High multicollinearity across stations  
- Low precision/recall for class 1 despite 99% overall accuracy  

---

## Problem Statement

Manual inspections are ineffective at identifying subtle quality deviations in sensor data. This project introduces a predictive analytics approach to reduce defects and improve response time to quality issues through automated diagnostics and preventive alerts.
